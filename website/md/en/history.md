	<h1>Brief history of development of axiom.top</h1>
	<p>
		In 2008, the writer embarked on the development of this axiomatized
		mathematical analysis system. The project is being developed mainly in
		the writer's spare time. At that time, the writer of this tool was
		still an undergraduate student. It was originally written in C++,
		based on a deutch project <a href="https://www.ginac.de/"> ginac</a>
		which is a C++ library for symbolic mathematical calculations. The
		axiom proving system was build on top of it.
	</p>
	<br>
	<p>
		In 2016, the writer discovered another open-source symbolic
		computation project, namely <a
			href="https://www.sympy.org/en/index.html"> sympy</a>, and another
		C++ project <a href="https://github.com/symengine/symengine.git">
			symengine</a> which is subset of sympy, as well as <a
			href="http://maxima.sourceforge.net"> Maxima </a> which is a
		Common-Lisp project, and also an open-source integrated tool: <a
			href="https://www.sagemath.org/"> sagemath</a> which is combined tool
		of Maxima, <a href="https://www.maplesoft.com/products/Maple/"> Maple</a>,
		Mathematica, <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html">
			Matlab</a>, and sympy. As Python is an more efficient language in
		developing (but not in executing) than C++, and a more popular /
		universal language than Common-Lisp, the writer mainly focused on
		developing with Python. Since then, this project was rewritten as /
		translated into a Python project.<br>
	</p>
	<br>
	<p>
		In 2018, the writer established a website, namely <a href="../axiom">
			axiom.top</a> for the purpose of sharing this axiomatized reasoning
		system. The writer also hopes that with the aid of open-source
		community, a large data-set can be established by volunteer engineers,
		so that further development of advanced analysis tool based on
		machine-learning methods can become possible.
